        We are working on finding the best way how to present these pictures...
        This is just the bare minimum. A better(?) slideshow-style presentation
        is here, but it might be broken, as it is work in progress.

        Data missing, we need your help!
        <br />
        We need info about what pictures show low/med/high. So if you have an
        opinion about the flow you see in the pictures, please{" "}
        <a href="mailto:toro@kanuschle.ch">tell us</a>.
        <br />
        Or, tell us when you paddled there and how you experienced that level.
        <br />
        Wishes, advice, contributions welcome too ;-)
