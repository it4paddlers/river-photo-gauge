# river-photo-gauge
This is code to present webcam-images of rivers,
meant to be used for judging the waterlevel
and to compare the depicted flow to reference-images
which show known levels of minimal/medium/high flow for paddling on that river.

A first use case is a [Webcam on the river Reuss](https://it4paddlers.org/webcams/wassen/index.php).
Currently we only have the very basic image presentation (from `index.php`), but on top of our TODO is a more practical user interface involving JS.
The prototype of that, so far with dummy content only, is testable [here](https://it4paddlers.org/webcams/wassen/app/build/) (the `app` folder from this repo).
