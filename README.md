# river-photo-gauge
This is code to present webcam-images of rivers,
meant to be used for judging the waterlevel
and to compare the depicted flow to reference-images
which show known levels of minimal/medium/high flow for paddling on that river.

A first use case is a [Webcam on the river Reuss](https://redpig.ch/webcams/wassen/index.php).
Currently we only have the very basic image presentation, but on top of our TODO is a more practical user interface involving JS.
