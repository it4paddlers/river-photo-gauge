You can see it in use on the [Webcam on the River Reuss](https://it4paddlers.org/webcams/wassen/).
The current State of this Project is a minimum viable product, see the [Issue Que](https://github.com/it4paddlers/river-photo-gauge/issues) for future Improvements.
Work on the React App was funded by [Swiss Canoe Federation](https://swisscanoe.ch/de/tourenwesen).
